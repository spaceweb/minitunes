Feature: User can add artist

  As a user
  So that I can share with others the artists I like
  I want to be able to add artists

Scenario: Add artist on Minitunes with a registered user
    Given I am logged in
    And   I visit the "Shakira" page
    Then  I follow "Add Artist"
    Then  I go to my "profile"
    Then  I should see "Shakira"

Scenario: Add artist on Minitunes with an unregistered user
    Given I am on the "Shakira" page
    Then  I follow "Add Artist"
    #Posible modificaci√≥n a "I should be on" pero recibo user (no esta programado)
    Then  I go to the Login page
